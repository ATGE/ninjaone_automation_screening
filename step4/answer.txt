1.) What is this code doing?
    In the first line it is declaring and assigning the vm variable to the VM by the name WPM returned when executing the Get-VM command,
    then it is also saving the Test-Path command to be passed in the next line when calling the Invoke-VMScript command
    Then it saves the result from executing the Invoke-VMScript command which sends a script to the VM using the required param -VM which comes from line 1.
    Then the result from invoking the script is saved in the Result variable, after that a condition that evaluates if the result is not equals to '0' it will print in color RED a message 
    indicating that an error occurred and will exit the program indicating a failure (1)

    If the program continues, it will save the Invoke-VMScript result in the output variable using the property ScriptOutput
    then it will evaluate the output if it returns true, it will print a successful message in color green 

    The program then kind of repeat the same logic but this time will run a script in the VM testing a different path, if the result returns true it will exit the program successful with a 0 exit code.

2.) What does the program assume you need to have access to in order to execute?
    It assumes you are an admin and have read access to the folder containing the virtual machine and a Virtual Machine.Interaction.Console Interaction privilege.
3.) What architectures can this script run on? 
    It can run in Windows 64
